# Titanic Dataset Analysis & Visualization
# Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset, using Python and visualization tools (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to uncover survival patterns, passenger demographics, and fare distributions.
# Key Analyses
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning and preprocessing data.

2. Histograms: Age and fare distribution insights.

3. Boxplots: Identifying outliers and trends.

4. Scatterplots: Exploring relationships between survival, age, fare, and family size.

5. Correlation Heatmap: Understanding relationships between numerical features.

# Findings
1. Survival rates were higher among first-class passengers.

2. Younger passengers had better survival chances.

3. Higher ticket fares correlated with increased survival probability.

4. Family size impacted survival—solo travelers had an advantage.
# Observations for Each Visualization
Here are key insights from each visualization in your Titanic dataset analysis:

1. Histogram (Age Distribution)
Most passengers were young adults, with a peak in the 20–30 age range.

A notable number of children were onboard.

Fewer older passengers, indicating a younger demographic overall.

2. Histogram (Fare Distribution)
Majority paid low fares, likely in third-class.

A few high-fare outliers suggest first-class luxury passengers.

The right-skewed distribution confirms a small number of high-paying passengers.

3. Boxplot (Age vs Passenger Class)
First-class passengers were generally older, likely wealthier individuals.

Third-class had younger passengers, possibly more families or immigrants.

Outliers suggest exceptions in each class.

4. Boxplot (Age vs Survival)
Younger passengers had higher survival rates, indicating priority in rescue efforts.

Older passengers had more varied survival patterns.

Median survival age was lower than non-survivors.

5. Scatterplot (Age vs Fare)
Older passengers tended to pay higher fares, likely choosing better cabins.

Young passengers paid lower fares, consistent with third-class travel.

Clusters suggest grouped family or shared cabin tickets.

6. Scatterplot (Fare vs Age Colored by Survival)
Higher-fare passengers had better survival rates.

Low-fare passengers show mixed survival trends.

First-class passengers had a significant survival advantage.

7. Scatterplot (Siblings/Spouses vs Parents/Children)
Many passengers traveled alone (SibSp = 0, Parch = 0).

Clusters suggest families with multiple siblings or parents.

Survival rates among families varied, but larger groups faced challenges.

# Summary of Findings
Passenger Class Influence: First-class passengers had higher survival rates.

Age and Survival Patterns: Children and young adults had better survival chances.

Fare Impact: Expensive fares correlated with increased survival likelihood.

Family Groups: Larger families faced survival disadvantages compared to solo travelers.

Gender Trends: Female passengers had significantly better survival odds.
